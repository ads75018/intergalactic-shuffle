Save the world from an evil Robot by showing it your best dance moves ! Intergalactic Shuffle was built using 3JS, P5 - with webcam integration and collision detection - and React.

Inspired by Japanese arcade games like Rez, Space Channel 5 and art by Hito Steyerl.

Music is from the game Nights into Dreams.
